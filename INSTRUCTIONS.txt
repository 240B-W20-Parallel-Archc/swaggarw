$ ./runs.sh

To plot all the output results, run the 'cachetime.py' as follows:

$ python3 cachetime.py -p

********************************************************************

INSTRUCTIONS:

The following instructions describe each file:
- cachetime.cpp: main c++ code file for cache performance
- cachetime.out: compiled cachetime.cpp
- cachetime.py: Python driver script which runs the cachetime.out, generates results, stores them in 'csvData' folder and generates plots in 'plots' folder.
- cpu_conf.jpg: screenshot of cpu configuration
- doit.sh: runs the cache performance code for random access for read and read-modify-write operations for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 threads.
- lscpu.jpg: output of lscpu on system
- Makefile: makefile with 'make' and 'make clean'options
- makeplots.py: plotting script which is imported by cachetime.py
- print_lscpu.sh: Shell script which prints the cache configuration of the CPU
- runs.sh: Shell script which deletes and recompiles the 'cachetime.out' executable and generates and prints all results for sequential and strided access.
